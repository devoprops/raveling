ok a few things.
1. Let's add a layer of abstractness to the effectors.  They are really just controlling the type of effect and amount, but don't capture some additional details.  
Let's have a base class of EffectStyle, and EffectOrchestrator that handles list or dict of effectstyles.  Effectstyles can be typed as 
PhysicalDamage, spell, buff, debuff, regen, process and subclassed accordingly (SpellEfeectStyle, etc.).  The base stype will inclued:
a. Name: Slash
b. Type: PhysicalDamage etc.
c. Description: weapon slash attack
d: effector: one of the effector classes

e. ExecutionText: (i.e. "You {action} the {target}" {kick}
